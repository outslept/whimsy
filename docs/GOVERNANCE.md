# Governance

To ensure clarity and transparency in our project's management, we encourage you to add a **GOVERNANCE** section. This file should outline how decisions are made, detail the roles within the project, and provide guidance on the governance structure. It can include information about:

- **Project Roles**: Define the responsibilities of contributors, maintainers, and other key participants.
- **Decision-Making Process**: Explain how decisions are made regarding features, bug fixes, and other significant changes to the project.
- **Community Involvement**: Describe how community members can engage in discussions and contribute to the decision-making process.

By clearly outlining these aspects, you can foster a more inclusive environment where contributors feel valued and informed.
